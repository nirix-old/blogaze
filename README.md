Blogaze
========

Simple blog powered by the Ramaze ruby framework.

See the [installation instructions](https://github.com/nirix/blogaze/wiki/Installation) on how to setup Blogaze.

WARNING
-------

Blogaze is currently in development, use at your own risk. Database migration files may be changed
requiring you to migrate down then up causing data loss unless you backup or modify the database yourself.

Todo
------

Things that still need to be done.

1. Post tags
3. Settings page
4. User manager
5. Profile manager

Why
------

There's two reasons why I've made Blogaze, the first is that I cant stand using PHP anymore
the second is that because I no longer want to use PHP, I need a non-php blog.

Gem?
------

Not yet, once this thing is actually _stable_ then there _may_ be a gem.
