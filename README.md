1. Post tags
2. Post comments
3. Settings page
4. User manager
5. Profile manager

Why
------

There's two reasons why I've made Blogaze, the first is that I cant stand using PHP anymore
the second is that because I no longer want to use PHP, I need a non-php blog.

Gem?
------

Not yet, once this thing is actually _stable_ then there _may_ be a gem.
