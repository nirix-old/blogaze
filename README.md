========

See the [installation instructions](https://github.com/nirix/blogaze/wiki/Installation) on how to setup Blogaze.

WARNING
-------

Blogaze is currently in development, use at your own risk. Database migration files may be changed
requiring you to migrate down then up causing data loss unless you backup or modify the database yourself.

Todo
------

Things that still need to be done.

1. Post tags
2. User manager
3. Profile manager

Why
------

I created Blogaze because I needed a non-PHP blog platform, why? I'm done with PHP.

Gem?
------

Probably not, its not something you really need a gem for, but who knows,
maybe one version 1.0 has been released.
